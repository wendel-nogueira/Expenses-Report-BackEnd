Expenses Report is a project that is being developed as part of the Hands On project, with its primary goal being the development of an expense report application. This repository aims to provide an API based on microservices architecture, which is consumed by the [Front End](https://github.com/wendel-nogueira/Expenses-Report-FrontEnd).

## üíª Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com) on your machine.

## üöÄ Installing Expenses Report API
